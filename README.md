## Why was it created

---

This project was created to refresh my knowledge and stay up to date with the latest technologies, paradigms and trends regarding the React Eco-system.
<br />
<br />
The tools used in this project are summed up above, and are accompanied by other libraries&adjustments like styled-components, mobile friendly interface, PWA capabilities ecc...

<br />

## How was it created

---

The whole application was created by following the [ZeroToMastery React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

I developed the app alongside the instructor, and added my own spin on it while coding to experiment on several features and patterns of the library, like hooks and typescript.

<br />

## Features

---

<br />

### ü§ñ **_Full Typescript Solution_**

<p style=margin-left:20px>
The project is entirely written in Typescript, using strict rules to force the explicit typing of every variable while avoiding bad practices like the use of the 'any' type.
</p>

<br />

### ü™ù **_Entirely written with Func.Components + Hooks_**

<p style=margin-left:20px>
The solution is built using functional components, AKA re-usable functions that hold all the logic necessary to render the UI.
</p>
<p style=margin-left:20px>
The state held by every function is managed by the React Hooks, namely useState, useEffect and many others.
</p>
<p style=margin-left:20px>
Also, several libraries like Redux and React-Router offer their own hooks, which I used to trim down boilerplate code and offer a cleaner architecture.
</p>

<br />

### ‚öõÔ∏è **_Redux Toolkit + Saga_**

<p style=margin-left:20px>
The chosen state-management library for this project is Redux. Specifically, Redux Toolkit, which is a set of tools that allow you to manage your Redux state in a declarative way, while removing a lot of boilerplate code.
</p>
<p style=margin-left:20px>
To accompany Redux Toolkit, I used Redux Saga, which is a library that allows you to manage asynchronous actions using the new Javascript Generator functions.
</p>

<br />

### ü§° **_JEST testing (snapshots and shallow reducers)_**

<p style=margin-left:20px>
Testing is a very important part of any project, so I used Jest to manage the automated-testing flow of this app.
</p>
<p style=margin-left:20px>
The only tests added for now are Snapshot Testing (for every route), and a shallow state check for every written reducer.
</p>

<br />

### üíÖüèΩ **_Styled Components_**

<p style=margin-left:20px>
Every component is styled using the styled-components library, which is a library that allows you to create styles in a declarative way using Javascript/Typescript.
</p>

> You can find more info about it [here](https://www.styled-components.com/).

<br />

### üí∏ **_Stripe API using NodeJS_**

<p style=margin-left:20px>
The E-Commerce platform checkout system is powered by the Stripe API, which is a payment gateway that allows you to accept credit card payments. The API is written in NodeJS, and is used to communicate with the Stripe API.
</p>
<p style=margin-left:20px>
The entire flow is managed to allow a user (authenticated or not) to manage items in a cart and then use a test credit card to simulate a checkout.
</p>

<br />

### üî• **_Firebase Managed Solution_**

<p style=margin-left:20px>
This React project is majorly a front-end solution, so to help with the backend side of things, I used Firebase.
</p>
<p style=margin-left:20px>
This service allowed me to manage users, products and carts all copupled with authentication, Google SSO and Database Rules without having to code a separate robust API from scratch.
</p>

> You can find more info about it [here](https://firebase.google.com/).

<br />

### ‚öôÔ∏è **_'Progressive Web App' Enabled_**

<p style=margin-left:20px>
This application is configured with a registered service worker, robots.txt and managed manifest to allow users to download the application as a PWA.
</p>
